I heard that you're settled down,
That you found a girl and you're married now,
I heard that your dreams came true,
Guess she gave you things I didn't give it to you,
Old friend, why are you so shy?
It ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it,
I had hope you'd see my face,
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you,
I wish nothing but the best for you two,
Don't forget me, I beg,
I'll remember you said,
"Sometimes it lasts and loves,
But sometimes it hurts instead,"
Sometimes it lasts and loves,
But sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
